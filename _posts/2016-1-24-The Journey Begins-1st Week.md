title: The Journey Begins-1st Week
---

First week of software Engineering was ok. We started with little intro of the class and then went over two python code file. Professor randomly choose people from class roster and asked about some python functions and operator from the python files. I am not a python guy, but with the help of google it shouldnt be a issue. This class requires to use lot of tools which is unfamilioar to me. Reading from the syllabus, this course requires almost 7000 lines fo code. So its not for those who doesnt like code. Writing test to break people's code to gets points sounds fun but i dont know how hard it will be becasue i never done it before. This class has multiple extra c redit opportuiny. One of them being writing this blog and another to open a porfolio is seelio.com. Except python3 we are required to download "coverage.py" which monitors python program, and identify the code that could have been excuted for possible reason but did not. Also also have to use "pydoc", automate the documentation fo a python module.Pydoc can turn documentation into HTML files and also upload online. We have to post a blog post every single wee k about our experince of the class so that whoever decides to take it next can have a overview of the class by reading this post. At this point the work of this course sounds/looks kind of more than average. Hopefully it will be a not a easy but ok semester.
